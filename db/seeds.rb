# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# location1 = Location.create(location_name: "Samura Papa", zipcode: 11216, menu: "good")

# location2 = Location.create(location_name: "Samura Mama", zipcode: 11211, menu: "nice")

# location3 = Location.create(location_name: "Samura Mama", zipcode: 11206, menu: "really cool")

# zip1 = Zip.create(zip_number: "11216"),
# zip2 = Zip.create(zip_number: "11211"),
# zip3 = Zip.create(zip_number: "11206")
